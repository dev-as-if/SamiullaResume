🧠 CORE FUNCTIONALITY

1️⃣ Conversational Resume Creation (Question–Answer Driven)
Entire resume creation happens via guided UI

UI behaves like:
MCQ
Short text input
Long text input

Flow is recursive and dynamic

Gemini should:
Ask follow-up questions if answers are vague
Adapt questions based on profession

Example:

UI asks: “What role are you applying for?”
User enters: “Waiter”
Gemini:

Generates 2–3 variations for:
Career objective
Roles & responsibilities
Skills

User selects one

User confirms

Content is inserted into resume

2️⃣ Resume Templates
Start with 5 profession-based resume templates

Templates must be:
ATS-friendly
Clean, semantic HTML
No tables for layout (use flex/grid)

Templates implemented as:
React components
Data-driven (JSON + CSS variables)

User can switch templates anytime

⚠️ PDF templates provided by the user should be:
Recreated as HTML/CSS equivalents
Optimized for ATS parsing
Font choices: standard ATS-safe fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)

3️⃣ Live Resume Preview
Split-screen UI:
Left: Conversational input
Right: Live resume preview

Updates instantly as content changes

Page auto-expands when content overflows

LLM suggests:
Content length optimization
Section improvements

4️⃣ Editing & Formatting
User can:
Edit generated content
Delete sections
Reorder sections

Inline editing directly inside preview

Formatting options:
Font size
Line spacing
Section spacing

5️⃣ LLM Help Button
